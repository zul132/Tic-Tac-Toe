# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe game built using Python
Problem Statement:
1. Create a Tic Tac Toe game with the following conditions
- Player ‘O’ should start the game by placing ‘O’ only at the
diagonals (in the first round alone). You can place it anywhere
else in the rest of the rounds.
- The diagonals should not be evaluated. Only top to bottom, left
to right and vice versa should be taken into account.
